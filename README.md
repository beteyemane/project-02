## Overview

Wevent is a web application that allows users to select a city and view events that are weather appropriate at that current time. For example, if the the current temperature is over a certain amount of degrees, events of an'outdoorsy' nature will be generated.

## Process

As the timeframe was only two days, we first began with a quick brainstorming session to identify the topics we were both interested in, then dived straight into searching for API's that we could use to build to use as our base product. 
We used two API's:
* Skiddle to extract data for our events 
* Weather Unlocked to get the current temperature of the different cities

We tested the endpoints of our API using Insomnia and started to build the front-end once we felt satisfied with the data being retrieved.
